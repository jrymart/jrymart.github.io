I have a bachelors in Geology from Oberlin College where I focused on GIS and Earth Surface Processes.  After graduating I worked as GIS Technician at Oberlin where I focused on GIS education.  Currently, in addition to my work at University of Vermont I am a member of the Education Working Group of the EarthCube IS-GEO Research Coordination Network.

<div class="about">
    <p>Currently I am PhD Student at University of Colorado working with Greg Tucker.  Between degrees I had a stint as a Security Engineer.  Prior to that I was a mathematics masters student at University of Vermont, where I focused in graph theory.  I'm interested in developing novel mathematical and computational methods for problems of Landscape Evolution.</p>

I am a PhD candidate in the department of Geological Sciences and the University of Colorado, Boulder.  I am supervised by [Gregory Tucker](https://cires.colorado.edu/people/gregory-tucker), and my research involves building and interpreting neural networks that can find subtle and complex signals in topography that can tell us about the processes and properties that shape landscapes.

I obtained my MS at the University of Vermont where I worked with Puck Rombach to solve a problem in extremal graph theory.  I have also worked as a cybersecurity engineer, GIS technician, and wrangled hippies in a commercial kitchen.

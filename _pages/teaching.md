I am passionate about figuring out ways to teach earth scientists to code.  Here you can find some coursework and pedagogical research related to this topic.

In 2023 and 2025 I was a teaching assistant for the class "Introduction to Python Programming for Earth Scientists" and developed a lesson (to be posted) introducing students to the geopandas library.

In 2017 I adapated a GIS course to include a significant Python scripting component.  The course overview including adapated exercises are available [here](https://serc.carleton.edu/teachearth/courses/200373.html), although they are rather out of date.

From 2017-2019, I was part of the education working group of the Intelligent Systems and Geosciences (IS-GEO) research coordination network.  In 2019 we wrote [an article](https://link-springer-com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1007/s11625-019-00735-3) that provided an overview of the courses, challanges, and competencies that had been developed to bridge earth and data science

# Periodic Boggle 

Recently I was at a conference that had a very large and distracting periodic table in the lecture hall.  I started looking for words spelled in the periodic table by adjacent elements.  Some simple ones are N→O, Si→P, La→Ce.  But don't stop there, play by [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) rules.  In short look for words made by chains of elements that are adjacent vertcialy, horizontaly, or diagonally, in any direction.  For elements with two letter
abreviations, use the first letter first.  Now we can get some longer words, P→O→S→Se, Dy→Es, and .

## Adjacency on the periodic table.
In your classic periodic table, adjacency on the table and "adjacency" of elements (whatever that is) don't always correspond.  For my Periodic Boggle I consider "adjacent" to mean having a difference of 1 in atomic number, or in the same "column" (this is sometimes the same as group, but I don't have a great understanding of exactly how the periodic table is organized).  Note that while in the classic periodic table the lanthanides and actinides are drawn is in the same columns as the rest of the periodic table, this is not the case!  Instead, I urge you to look at the [Theodor Benfey's alternate Periodic Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_periodic_tables#Two-dimensional_spiral_.28Benfey.2C_1964.29) (included below), which I think does the best job at showing the true adjacency of the elements.  

Now you can see that there are even more words to find, like Ar→K!

## Interesting Questions
This is a fun game to play if you ever find yourself sitting in front of a periodic table for a long *period* of time, but it yeilds some interesting questions, which imply a nice generalization of Boggle (more on this later).  Here are some questions I think are worth at least a little bit of pondering.

- What's the longest word that can be spelled?  (Send me your bests!)
- How many words/what perecentage of words can be spelled like this (Send me the words you've found!)
- If you could add one "link", that is, make any two elements adjacent, which would give the biggest increase to the number of words that can be found.
- How many more words could be found with a relaxation of rules (one mispelling, one dropped letter).
